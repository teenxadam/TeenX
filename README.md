      <h2>What does it mean to be a BlaccMan in love?</h2>
      <h3>Lifes a trip.
      </h3>
      <p>NOBODY EVER BELIEVES ME. U tend to have alot of crushes when you look and act like the flyest guy in the room. But then
    no one really trusts you like being their friend or wanna engage in things with them cause you push back on the things
    you genuinely don’t understand. Everyones so selfish, but so am I so whatever, if you fell in love at first sight youd be
    scared too. ~Adam Ocean</p>
      <h2>15 WAYS TO $IMP FOR HER</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Listen</li>
        <h3>Even when you don’t really want to.</h3>
        <p>Even when you don’t really want to.
        Sometimes all it takes is knowing youre listening, Not judging or expecting to gain anything out of what youre listening
        to but that you are. You even hear some of the craziest shit when you wait to say “alright can we move on now.”.</p>
        <li>Smile when she looks at you</li>
        <h3>You know she makes you smile the same way.(maybe even harder)</h3>
        <p>The feeling of looking at that person in your life that makes you smile without even realizing it(thats 43 muscles
        moving uninhibited).Shit is beautiful deadass.

</p>
        <li>Have fun</li>
        <h3>Who made you the fun police?</h3>
        <p>What’s fun to you may not be fun for her, vice versa, that doesn’t mean finding a dope ass middle ground isnt possible.
        Be patient, work something out. Ya’ll be glad You did.</p>
        <li>If its not a yes its a no</li>
        <h3>There are over 7billion fish in the sea.</h3>
        <p>Why wait for the no thats never gonna come, don’t wait around for the No you think might be coming or the yes that you
        know definitely isnt coming. Just know in her own way her not saying no is letting you know she thought you were
        pretty decent. And thats a start.</p>
        <li>Beware the side eye</li>
        <h3>Once you’ve gotten here, turn back now!</h3>
        <p>Once you’ve gotten here, turn back now!
        Theres always times when going to far is toooo far. You may not always know when you say things that are overstepping
        boundaries or harmful to their feelings but when they act like it hurts, don’t gaslight them and act like it doesn’t.They know how to hit you where it hurts... ur balls!</p>
        <li>Make fun of stuff together</li>
        <h3>The World is yours!</h3>
        <p>No one can tell us shit. You should know what is and what isn’t legitimate criticsm. Everyones someone else’s critic
        thats why its fun to laugh at the inevidabiltiies in life cause theres nothing that’ll ever please either of you. Might
        as well laugh at the fact you have someone you know laughs at you too.</p>
        <li>Be Sexually Intelligent</li>
        <h3>You’re reading this. Already off to a good start!</h3>
        <p>So you’ve got a crush and they playin, don’t get mad, get smart. Y(ou)tube is free the internet is free in a-lot of places
        surprisingly. With the low-cost of an iPhone(lmaooooooo) and some time look into some audio books on sexual
        intelligence. Its 2021, take that energy into understanding why you feel the way you do and how you can change that. If
        its still the same after. Its not you its them.</p>
        <li>Ask Questions</li>
        <h3>“Why am I like this?”</h3>
        <p>Most likely youre parents, and you for repeating those cycles for so many years after, but that doesn’t mean shit,
        Todays what makes tomorrow(literally) fuck up In the right direction till all youre cycles are benefiting you.</p>
        <li>Remember the little things</li>
        <h3>You know what they say size doesn’t matter.
</h3>
        <p>You know what they say size doesn’t matter.
When you randomly bring things up that are otherwise minimal. It shows alot about what you keep ur mind on. Knowing you think about the random bs that they do or thinks really goes along way in making her feel present.</p>
        <li>Go out with a bang</li>
        <h3>Goodbyes don’t last forever</h3>
        <p>Go big or go home fuck it, the least you can do is be remembered as the guy that did too much. Dont worry! if your heart
        says its a good idea let that shit bang. But when she’s still with that other nigga don’t say you didnt know that when
        you had this all planned...</p>
        <li>Have a plan</li>
        <h3>all u gotta do is think!</h3>
        <p>All you gotta do is think!
        The more you plan the better the outcome becomes, so when you plan out that special date after a week of working or a
        long fight, work really hard on those details you’ll be alot happier later knowing you did.</p>
        <li>Breakfast inbed n-chill</li>
        <h3>who wouldnt wanna eat you...thats all.</h3>
        <p>Waking up early sucksssss. But it doesn’t have to, especially not when it takes two seconds to pop some eggos, make some
        bacon, and then get treated to some cake in bed for all your hard work.
</p>
        <li>Partnas in Time</li>
        <h3>Just cause you said goodbye doesnt mean you shouldnt say hello.</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it’s really hard to come back into someones life especially after a hard falling out, but ya are both stuck on
        this planet any way. As long as you don’t try too hard to make it seem like ur the hottest shit to French tips chill.</p>
        <li>the more things change the longer they stay the same</li>
        <h3>Everyone likes being comfortable.</h3>
        <p>Everyone likes being comfortable.
        When shit looks scary, it seems like it’d be easier just to ignore it then actually realize it cant do shit too you, but
        the more time you spend noticing and gradually adjusting to the developments in the world around you, you find out
        getting back in step with her was a-lot easier than you thought.</p>
        <li>Dont think about it too much</li>
        <h3>the less I know the better</h3>
        <p>Sometimes things are better left off unsaid, if you cant take not hearing it and the world crumbles around you, chances
        are you probably already knew. The important things can be conveyed with and without words in a way that stresses what
        both parties find and think are important to one another. After that its up to you to accept what bs you have to deal
        with.
